# Esopo

## Title
This command line application is designed to store text data for the purpose of returns us an interpolated one-line text and further use in the terminal.
You can create/open/delete and run files.
The following commands are provided for interpolation:\n
%{get_uuid} - returns UUIDv4\n
%{get_phone} - returns the phone number (starts with +7)\n
%{get_number} - returns a random number with a length of 7 numbers\n
%{get_timestamp} - returns the current timestamp in iso8601 format\n
%{get_variable} - user variable required in case of dynamic variable. For example paste URL, list of commands.

##Example

 I suggest creating a file, for this we will write a simple command.
```
esopo create example_command
```

A txt file is created inside the project and opened in your notepad in order to write data into it for further interpolation
let's insert the following data into our file. The data was taken from the site https://json-generator.com
```
'{
    "guid": "%{get_uuid}",
    "isActive": true,
    "balance": "$2,748.23",
    "age": "%{get_variable}",
    "eyeColor": "green",
    "name": "Sondra Chaney",
    "gender": "female",
    "company": "%{get_number}",
    "email": "sondrachaney@zuvy.com",
    "phone": "%{get_phone}",
    "registered": "%{get_timestamp}",
    "latitude": 23.141088,
    "longitude": 6.578343
}'
```

I list the variables that we inserted for further interpolation
- %{get_uuid} — This command will return UUIDv4 format
- %{get_variable} — The user variable serves us to insert user data. By default, it is equal to nil, it will return only what the user specifies with the run command
- %{get_number} — This command will return us the generated number with a length of 7 characters
- %{get_phone} — This command will return us the generated phone number, the number will start with +7
- %{get_timestamp} — This command will return us the utc date and time in iso8601 format

Let's call the run command
```
esopo run my_age example_command
# esopo — our cli
# run — run
# command my_age — user data for the variable %{get_variable}
# example_file — our file that needs to be outputted
```

We get the next result
```
'{"guid":"491b63e5-9a84-4f72-75c7-38fd35bfa6bf","isActive":true,"balance":"$2,748.23","age":"my_age","eyeColor":"green","name":"Sondra Chaney","gender":"female","company":"ZUVY","email":"sondrachaney@zuvy.com","phone":"+72373248105","registered":"2023-02-18T18:50:29Z","latitude":23.141088,"longitude":6.578343}'
```
